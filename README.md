# rn-pokedex

a React-Native pokedex app using vanilla javascript

api found at https://pokeapi.co/

git clone with an install should work as api call was using fetch, 
I would usually use axios and redux but with a simple project this was not needed.
stylesheet for styling made this a a good 

used VScode and Xcode, have not tested on android studio.
